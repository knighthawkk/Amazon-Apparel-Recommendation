# Amazon-Apparel-Recommendation

In this I have Created a Recommendation Engine that Recommends Apparels based on the Similarity of the Title of the Product

The Data was collected from Amazon.com's Product Advertising API

As the Title is a text feature, NLP based Algorithms such as BOW, TFIDF, TFIDF-AVG-W2V have been used.

Also VGG16 CNN is used to recommend based on the similarity of the Images.
